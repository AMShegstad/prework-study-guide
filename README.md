# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The Prework Study Guide Webpage is a web application that can be utilized as a note taking tool early in this Boot Camp. If properly utilized, the website will serve two purposes: (1) building this web application is a good refresher in HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript, and (2) regular updates to this web application will help solidify my ability to use vs code and Git.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.
